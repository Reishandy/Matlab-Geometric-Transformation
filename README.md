# Geometric Learning Application

**An interactive tool designed for learning geometry through hands-on visualizations and exercises.**

## Description
The Geometric Learning Application is a MATLAB-based educational tool that enables users to explore and interact with various geometry concepts. This app is especially useful in educational settings, allowing both students and educators to engage with geometric shapes and transformations intuitively.

### Key Features
- **Geometric Transformations**: Modules for exploring and understanding transformations like rotation, reflection, dilation, and translation.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Equipped with multiple buttons and menus, the app makes it easy to navigate and explore.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Each concept is accompanied by animations and visuals that help users observe transformations in real-time.
- **Ideal for Educational Use**: Suitable for classroom learning and individual study.
